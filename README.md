This is a decentralized press model📄 that utilizes both IPFS🌠 for frontend deployment and Ethereum blockchain🔗 for backend deployment. The model allows authors✒️ to publish their articles, essays, and writings📚 on a distributed platform. Subscribers can purchase a non-fungible token (NFT) membership card to access the content. The funds💰 generated from these purchases are distributed to the content providers or authors through a smart contract📜, ensuring that the content providers are financially supported for their work and can continue to contribute to the community. The smart contract also ensures that the funds💰 are distributed fairly and transparently. The use of IPFS🌠 and blockchain🔗 technology ensures that the platform is decentralized and resistant🛡 to censorship🔏.
